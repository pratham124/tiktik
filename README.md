<h1>TikTik</h1>

<p>A social media application where users can upload videos, like videos, comment on videos, and search for users or videos. Using Google OAuth, users are able to log in with their google account. The user state is managed using redux with the addition of redux-persist package. With redux-persist, we were able to persist the state onto local storage, so that the state would not be reset on reload.</p>
